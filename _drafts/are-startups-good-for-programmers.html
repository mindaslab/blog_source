<p>India launched a scheme called Startup India. Though being in startups for years, I don't think I am being positively affected by it, what ever i think families of rich and political class will surely grow in wealth because of this. Any way in this article I am going to analze weather startups are good for programmers.</p>
<p>So from programmers perspective what startups offer</p>
<p><strong>5x salary</strong></p>
<p>Salaries in startups are very high. Thats because startups can fail easily, people need financial security, so they demand very high to work there. A typical startup guy will look to earn the same amount in 2 months what he would earn in an year working in other software companies.</p>
<p>Some startups try to offset this by offering stock options, but whats the use in getting stock options when there is huge risk of failure. So many programmers avoid it today.</p>
<p><strong>Lean work culture</strong></p>
<p>Another thing startups offer is lean work culture, that is teams have no hierarchy, no boss and no subordinates. In  a typical corporate there is huge hierarchy and lots of answering to do. Lots of documentation had to be done and things must be in non agile fashion that would piss off an programmer. In startups only your ability to think and create matters.</p>
<p>There are no concepts of leave breaks, but you will have lot of coordination instead of meetings (thats meetings renamed so that you don't feel bad :p)</p>
<p>Plus  in startups you get lot of spending power without questioning. If I need to buy a computer in  a corporate, I need to do lot of paperwork and stuff, but in a startup, I can buy it like I can buy it for myself.</p>
<p>One can work from startups, but this culture is now coming into corporates too as a cost cutting measure.</p>
<p><strong>Party life</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Stupid boss</strong></p>
<p><strong>Abuse</strong></p>
<p><strong>Taste of failure</strong></p>
<p><strong>Bad health</strong></p>
