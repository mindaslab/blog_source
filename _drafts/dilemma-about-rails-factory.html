<p>Theoretically I am into rails factory and I have some kind of unwanted feeling. Many say that company is worst, people in it have head weight, the treatment of employees are poor. I don't know. I don't this thing will be as worst as Expertus treatment. Under it I was under a fanatic called Uday and I didn't know what to do. Worst still Expertus wouldn't pay me.</p>
<p>Fuck fuck fuck.</p>
<p>My only hope is Rails factoryÂ  is a changed company right now, listening to its employees. GOOOOD fuck GOD. Why can't spritle have its projects and why did Balaji hire me if he did not have reserve money.Damn. Bloody damn.</p>
<p>Some times I think I missed out AMP. Why can't family have a business with me playing a role in it. I know I have excellent mind, feel dismayed that I don' have life I desired. Just don't know how to earn quickly, possibly stock investment?</p>
