<p>Its important to hire people you trust. Your company is your business and its your life and soul. It should e run by people you purely trust so  that you don't get Satanic thoughts in your mind. In this post I will be telling you four incidents that greatly affected me and made me cultivate distaste for those companies.</p>
<p>The first one was in  a company where the boss was very close to me. He had hired his niece for a tech job and she was under me. It was a industrial automation company. The girl wanted to leave at some point due to her personal reasons, she came and asked me and I said okay. She went to the bosses room and talked with him. Later the boss called me into his room and said 'she is leaving soon, extract as much work as possible'. It shocked me. A boss should be able to see the pain of people working under him and should be able to relieve the pain, or else the company is as good as paralyzed body thats unable to feel pain.</p>
<p>The second incident happened in a content creation company. I already felt terrible because they advertised for Ruby on Rails or a Python guy and showed me a team and Joomla prroject. They wouldn't understand the difference between PHP, Python, or Ruby. Though we were web developers, internet access to us was severely limited, no kidding, its the truth.</p>
<p>One day we struck an performance issue and x-prof was needed to analyze the situation as the company won't used paid profiling tools. I went to the website and found it was blocked. I requested the admin, sent mails and nothing happened, and my devs were bugging me. I had no option and after my patience ran out I lashed out at the admin, never knew the lazy idiot had contacts at the top. I was screwed. One day a director took me into his room and insulted me as the admin was his personal friend I had to end my consultation prematurely.</p>
<p>In another incident, a guy who worked under me came to me with a  pale face, and he told that people were speaking about his game playing habit in office, inface one of my peers have warned him. He looked absolutely destroyed. Tyrants monitor their people and try to control them. Programming is like poetry. I don't believe you can imprison a poet and expect the best out of him, even if he does the poetry will be against your tyranny. I wonder why such people who are tyrants were in the business.</p>
<p>In another incident, two women who were head of Prevention of Sexual Harassment in our company were bullying two guys, they were saying that not putting the first button on ones shirt is equivalent to eve teasing. It shocked me how people could misuse power.</p>
<p>Once a lady peer of mine in office accused me of harassing her just because I caught her red handed in an issue.</p>
<p>It worries me, why people are so mistreated and are so dishonest. If one hires a developer or has developer under them, one must trust them rather than mistreat them.</p>
<p>So its important you hire people you trust. Only if you trust them and know that they are perfectly honest and hard working, your company will retain talent, or else it will loose out.</p>
