<p>Sometimes I feel really sorry for myself to be in India. Its a great land, founding fathers have put an excellent constitution,  but the court really has no power in the land. Okay thats another matter. I am 31, in India its high time to marry. there is too much pressure for it.</p>
<p>The first thing is this, people ask me why I don't ant a dowry. Well if I say I don't want to feel like a prostitute that would be offensive, one would think I am calling him  a prostitute just because got it</p>
