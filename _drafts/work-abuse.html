<p>'The first company you started must have been a fluke', 'you are not an engineer', 'do you know what team work is?', 'you are not a team worker'. These were the words I heard from my previous employer (Techartus) which shocked me. This rang inside me al the time hampering work. With another purely illogical scolding I quit.</p>
<p>The irony is I did not go into a well established corporation in Pune citing that I wanted work for this tiny company. Once inside I just found garbage in it. Its supposed to be a company that offered Engineering service. Like bingo we struck a huge project, it could have been executed well. Its a multi crore one. Good team could have been hired, great technology could have been used, and it could have advanced really quickly.</p>
<p>Yet for some unknown reason, we used technology that was at-least 10 years old. Techniques that I used when I started off as a web developer. The progress was slow and error prone. The answer for this is night work. It ruined my colleges and my mental health. The day work got more slower and inefficient. The answer for that, burden more work on us so that we can finish it.</p>
<p>As if those were not enough we had scoldings now and then for the in slowness. God, fucking God!!!! At the end it was too much to bear. Unable to see my self happy and unable to see my colleges happy, I quit. I wonder why there is so much work abuse. I wonder why bosses can't understand the value of modern technology.</p>
<p>I came out and in span of 3 days wrote code for an e-commerce system which my friend commissioned, and it will be launched soon. Idiots, bloody idiots they are.</p>
