<p>Believe it or not, Ruby was crated to bring smile upon programmers. Thats the primary motive of it. But once you start adding management guys and administration to it, you end up in a mess. Though Ruby has eased many programmers life's, many programmers feel miserable due to the offices they work. Especially programmers in India.</p>
