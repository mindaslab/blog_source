<p>Look like all humans who are living are living because either they or their ancestors have sinned for their survival. Those who were pure along with their families were and are being wiped off. Despite that there are certain merciful and good people (who pop up now and then), who are forced to ask help from others due to circumstances. The world forces them just because the entire world is sinned and they are pure, and its these people who are caught for their innocent behavior and because they see themselves in others and trust them thinking others are good, and they are blind to evil. You can't teach them negative things to survive as their souls are pure and never able to understand harshness of evil greedy humanity which is always in need of progress no matter what. To defend those people loosing ones pride, ones life, telling a lie is not so bad.</p>
<p>I wish God exists and walks on earth once again for these pure souls.</p>
