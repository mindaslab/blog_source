<p>Working in a scientific industry is a boon. Science either says yes or no, there is no politics in it. Humans add politics to institutions that use science and technology toÂ  make money. Thats sad, but thats how things work.</p>
<p>My challenge in my present company was this, develop a team that does coding for fun. Fortunately, the rules of recruiting for it are simple, recruit some one who likes to solve puzzles or play games or something like that.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>So how to build a fun centric team</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. Recruit a person who you know</strong></p>
<p>2. Recruit some one who codes well</p>
<p>3. Recruit a explorer</p>
<p>4. Stay away from money</p>
<p>5. Never go against your people</p>
<p>How to have a fun centric culture</p>
<p>1. Bash the customer</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/X17puIB.gif" alt="" /></p>
<p>2. Ignore management</p>
<p>3. Make your team science centric</p>
<p>Say no is no</p>
<p>4. Slash red tape</p>
<p>5. Don't be afraid of annulment</p>
