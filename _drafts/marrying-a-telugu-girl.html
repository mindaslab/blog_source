<p>I am totally against these arranged marriages. I feel something in it is not right. Then when you i pass time and enjoy being bachelor, I don't know why people ask about getting married. Its gets to a point when you feel okay to give up your freedom and get entangled in this meaningless reproductive loop.</p>
<p>So I entered this Bharat Matrimony, possibly largest matrimony site in India. At the same time I got an offer to be CTO of another matrimony site but since I am morally bound to Techartus, I said no, in rather unpleasant way :/ , plus the matrimony site was poorly engineered and sucked with old technology that was crappy slow.</p>
<p>Any way. I have this fear of using Bharat Matrimony, people say that prostitutes have accounts in it. I don't know how much is true, but its giving me quiet a scare. Its not like I am against prostitution, if I were I must be killing most of my friends to have relation ship with their wife’s because she gave dowry to him. But I..... yak hate it. Its like eating spinach. I am not the guy for it.</p>
<p>Well, first bharat matrimony showed pictures of beautiful girls, I expressed interest and all of them turned me down, now I am getting moderate faces on my time line or what every, and hmmmm.... its turning out to be boring issue. I know now why many married guys hate their life’s. If those people were not afraid to kill themselves, possibly we might not be having this over population issue.</p>
<p>Well now I am getting messages from Telgu girls. Well, there is nothing wrong about that, but it annoys me. First Telgu people work on dowry, as I said its like eating spinach. It sucks. Second my first two girl friends were Telgu. Though I missed them at breakup, now I feel really glad they are not in my life.</p>
<p>For some reason I have felt really uncomfortable with Telgu people, donno why. When I watch their movies its totally funny. When they speak I feel like laughing. Their language does not sound interesting lets say like Spanish. Its like Murphy's law, I run behind Tamil girls, all turn me down and girls from Andhra run behind me... Yikes.</p>
