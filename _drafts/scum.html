<p>In every company, particularly in every information technology company, there is a scum layer which I know.Â  This is mostly the middle management layer. Usually one invests and starts a company so that he can enjoy perpetual wealth, such kind of investors bother very less about their own companies. This would result in them hiring high number of managers to manage their companies work force and these people turn out to be scum.</p>
<p><strong>How scum is made</strong></p>
<p>This scum is a unique layer of people, unlike the owners they do not invest, unlike the workers they do not work, they sit in the middle and enjoy the easy money. Most of their work is to communicate the top orders uninformed decision to the workers, be an "yes boss" person to the top order, motivate or demotivate the workers depending upon the situation, be an emailer and spreasheeter for some projects. These people will become so less skilled that they are unable to move from the company where they have become scum to any other company.</p>
