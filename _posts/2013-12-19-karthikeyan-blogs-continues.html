<p>Hello people, Tamilnadu Police have ceased my blogs http://is.gd/kblogs and my email id mindaslab@gmail.com , for reasons they claim are legal.</p>
<p>So I am starting my new blogs here. This will be my personal blog as well as my professional one. Even my other blog http://acupofrails.wordpress.com is with them!</p>
<p>I wish them, The Tamilnadu Government and India good luck in proving to others that we are not a true democracy. I believed so much in this nation, but if I get a chance now I might as well become citizen of another that respects personal freedom.</p>
<p>Wish this nation cultivates lot of tolerance, art of ignorance , and understands and respects once privacy.</p>
