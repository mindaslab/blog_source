I just told on the Internet that my ruby book has a permanent webpage here [https://mindaslab.github.io/I-Love-Ruby/](https://mindaslab.github.io/I-Love-Ruby/) and to my suprise I had more than 550 visitors less than 2 days. Thats a lot for programming book.

Yes the book is a good one, you will know when you visit "What people say" section. Many people have given good reviews about it. I did have bad reviews from people, but soon found out they were bogus except for one or two who pointed out some grammatical mistakes. I was affected by lot of prejudice too.

Overall I am happy, a language thats made me food, given me shelter and clothing for some time is made easy to understand by me. I wanted to say how my book smashed things.

**Its free**

My book is free 100%. Free in material, as you can download it free from Github.

Its also free by soul. Its been copyrighted under GNU free documentation license (GFDL) so that all humanity can use it without restrictions.

**Not restricted by publisher**

If I went to a publisher, I would have had lot of restrictions. People would have told this and that and I would have given up. Without publisher, I had no deadline. The first books of I Love Ruby had very less content, but then editions started to appear, sometimes even more than one edition per day. Today this has got a term now, they call rolling release. This lack of management and the ability to write when I want to write may have brought out the best in me.

# Looking for sponsors

I am looking for Ruby related companies to sponsor my work. If you like to please contact me. I am wishing to spend my time writing books so that people can understand technology better, become a better technician and earn with a smile. Sponsoring won't be easy as I am not willing to give up my sovereignty for money. But if you think Ruby has made your life better for you and your office you might consider to sponsor.
