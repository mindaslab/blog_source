Long long ago I was working in a kind of company that was corporate but called itself a startup to please itself.  There I was introduced to a management tool that was excellent and it captured the mindset of todays developers. The client then terminated his project and I approached the I.T department of the company about th product and they did not understand its significance.

As time went by many startups began to use the tool and now its a thriving business. I have my own company now and wanted to use the tool badly, but it was prohibitively expensive. My company is a small one and cannot afford it, but I did not want to loose productivity.

In our free time we started to  clone the tools features and within a month using Ruby on Rails we have our own tool now. Mine is a pure service company and because of a hobby we have a product now. Now we can use the productivity tool for 1/5th of its original cost. Its an enormous saving.

We can offer it cheap so that many Indian companies can now use it too.  Still we haven't rolled it in our office, but others are stunned what Ruby on Rails team has done. Most of the credit goes to awesome Ruby as well as the Rails community. We were able to look at the behavior of the tool and we were able to come up with our own. We took the good features and dropped off the boring features.

Despite many javascript frameworks bragging about their stuff, we used none, none more than jQuery. It was a good exercise we had done, it would surely benefit us, and possibly benefit the world if we move the tool in right direction.
