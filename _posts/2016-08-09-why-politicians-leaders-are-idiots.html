<p>I have always wondered why our politicians and leaders are idiots. If you take for instance http://dilbert.com , you would find a boss who is really stupid and people who are much better than him in intelligence work under him. In real world thats the true case. Money flows to people who work hard and who are energetic and stupid, and others wonder how they had done it. One of my friend too laments about how rich people are total idiots and how their kids are turning out to be more idiotic than them.</p>
<p>Well, this explains http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/health-news/research-suggests-being-lazy-is-a-sign-of-high-intelligence-a7176136.html . It turns out that intelligent people are so amused with our own thought, we don't need to do anything, we can just afford to be happy and lazy right on the spot, just without doing a thing. Whereas those with less brain activity and thought in them need to keep active so that their brains gets amused. So they try stuff, be active and achieve.</p>
<p>Our reward system awards achievers and sees those who are active and energetic gets money. In other words we humans were stupid enough to create a system where stupids get more money and power, no wonder!</p>
<p>So when ever you see a successful person than you, don't worry, you know that you are lazy, you should be sure that he or she is more brain dead than you.</p>
