<p>I work in  a corporate that calls a itself a startup so that they feel good about it. Everyday I see unwanted pressures created, people overworking, unhappy, stressed and chaosed thoughts running in their mind. They are good minds. I often wonder why good minds should face such  thing.</p>
<p>There is a great multilingual poet called Subramaniy Bharathi. He had to face humanity, poor thing that he was one among them just like we are all. He got so so fed up and sang to God Shakthi and asked: why do  you make me live in this trash</p>
<p>Ages upon ages, we humans have been chasing falsehood, false hopes that will never materialize. Being in Chennai I have seen life getting tougher and tougher for people. When I was young, any one who came to our doorstep, or of any of our neighbors were offered food. Now I don't even offer water to unless and until I know I profit in some way. What has happened? Has Ubuntu vanished from this land?</p>
<p>I feel the basis is hunger, In a city like Chennai even if you get Rs 20,000/- per month as salary, you can eat heartily 3 times a day. Its sad. Some are doing some thing about it. The government has launched subsidized food scheme. But I suspect that it was launched by Jaya (our Chief minister) to wash off her sins as  advised by her astrologer rather than in  a true spirit of vanishing hunger. Any way its a good thing.</p>
<p>I want to eliminate this stupid hunger. I want to create a farm which produces (organic) food. Every operation of the farm will be online, every knowhow and research we do will be there for free so that any one can use it. All the produce of the farm (minus those needed for the survival of the farmers) will be left out so that any one can take it and do what ever they want. There will be online portal where any one can donate money for this farm and its expansion. If we get enough money this farm will survive or it will perish.</p>
<p>The second objective of this farm would be to develop technology to preserve excess food and make it available to agriculturist over the world at no cost.</p>
<p>The third step will automation, so that robots will start to farm, and we humans could become free. This technology too will be open and given to any one who want it.</p>
<p>The fourth step would be to spread the message so that one day, all over the world, food will be available to any one free of cost and so that humanity could reach higher goals.</p>
<p>In a age were food production will be dominated big corporations (in India, well USA has lost it to the big money) that keep everything behind locked doors, I think we hit back and and say to them you are not the one to determine when we are hungry or not.</p>
<p>I really don't know how I am going to do it. But I want to network with like minded people. If you are one please contact me at +91 9444018524 or email to 77minds@gmail.com</p>
