I was in car with an owner of a Travels company, he said about a personal incident. In his private car was a Hindu driver, he (the driver) one day saw a sticker of Shiva which looked great, he bought it and stuck it in the car so that he can worship it. After a while a day when he was on a holiday, another Christian driver took charge of the car. It was just a one day job for him. When he saw the Shivas image he started to shiver, he said that these images should not be in  the car and removed it off. The travels owner being a Hindu himself, but recognizing the driver is kind of a psycho let the Christian proceed his way so that at least his job won't be blocked on that day.

I have heard of government teacher say something similar. A poojai was done in his house, he took laddus as prasadam to his school. He gave laddu to fellow teachers, when he said that laddu was a prasadam, one of the teaches spit it out. She said she is not supposed to eat "Hindu food". Then why she is eating food grown in India? All farmers offer their produce to Hindu Gods and only then sell them.

I myself have witnessed an incident. I asked for change from my friend who was a christian, he gave me two five rupee coins, I returned one of them saying that I need only 5 rupees, the coin was nice brass golden color, on its heads was beautiful image of Durga devi, I showed it to him and said that its rare to find coins like these. He flipped the one he had and after seeing Durga, I don't know what happened to him, he placed the coin on table and left it off. It looked as though he was really afraid.
