    class=\"reblogged-content\">\n\nWhen it comes to small CNC carving machines for
    hackerspaces and extremely well-equipped garages, the Shapeoko, or something like
    it, has been the default machine. It's dead simple - a Dremel attached to linear
    rails - and is useful for everything from milling PCBs to routing complex woodworking
    project to plotting designs with a pen. Now, [Bart Dring], the guy behind the
    Buildlog.net lasers and Inventables <a href=\"https://www.inventables.com/technologies/x-carve\">have
    teamed up to create the next generation of carving machines</a>. It's called the
    X-Carve, and while it's fully compatible with the Shapeoko 2, it adds a few improvements
    that make for a much better machine.\r\n\r\nThe X-Carve does away with the Dremel-based
    spindle and replaces it with something that can produce torque. There's a 24VDC
    spindle in the stock arrangement that will give you speed control through Gcode.
    There is, of course, adapters to fit the Dewalt and Bosch routers most commonly
    used in these types of machines.\r\n\r\nAs far as the gantry goes, the X and Y
    axes are makerslide; no change there. The Z axis leadscrew has an optional upgrade
    to Acme threaded rod, an improvement over the M8 threaded rod found in just about
    every other DIY machine kit. The entire machine is basically all the upgrades
    a Shapeoko should have, with stronger corners, NEMA 23 motors, and increased rigidity.\r\n\r\nThere
    are a few versions of the X-Carve, ranging from an upgrade kit to the Shapeoko
    2 to a fully loaded kit with a square meter of machine space. The big, high-end
    kit ships for around $1250, but a smaller kit with 500mm rails, NEMA 17s, and
    threaded rod lead screw is available for around $800.\r\n\r\n[Bart] and [Zach],
    the founder of Inventables sat down and shot a video going over all the features
    of the X-Carve. You can check that out below.\r\n\r\n<!--more-->\r\n\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTQrP5vEK-Q</div>\";s:15:\"images_mirrored\";i:1;}"
