    class=\"reblogged-content\">\n\nFor years now, some researchers have been anticipating
    that robots would take away jobs from humans. In the UK, Deloitte and the University
    of Oxford predicted that 10 million unskilled jobs could be taken over by robots.
    University of Oxford researchers Carl Benedikt Frey and Michael Osborne estimated
    in 2013 that <a href=\"http://www.futuretech.ox.ac.uk/future-employment-how-susceptible-are-jobs-computerisation-oms-working-paper-dr-carl-benedikt-frey-m\"
    target=\"_blank\">47 percent of total U.S. jobs</a> could be automated and taken
    over by computers by 2033.\r\n\r\nSome experts say not to worry because technology
    has always created new jobs while eliminating old ones ones, <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2014/02/18/some-predict-computers-will-produce-a-jobless-future-heres-why-theyre-wrong/\"
    target=\"_blank\">displacing but not replacing workers</a>. But lately, as technology
    has become more sophisticated, the drumbeat of worry has intensified. \"What's
    different now?â\x80\x9D asked Leigh Watson Healy, chief analyst at market research
    firm Outsell. â\x80\x9CThe pace of technology advancements plus the big data phenomenon
    lead to a whole new level of machines to perform higher level cognitive tasks.\"
    Translated: the old formula of creating more demanding jobs that need advanced
    training may no longer hold true. The number of people needed to oversee the machines,
    and to create them, is limited. Where do the many whose occupations have become
    obsolete go?\r\n\r\n\"I don't think we have a good handle on this,\" said MIT
    researcher Matt Beane. \"The end game scenarios seem kind of severe. From here
    on in, it's really, really, really going to change and it's going to change faster
    than we can handle.\"\r\n\r\nUntil recently, it was largely blue collar jobs that
    have felt the brunt, as technologies automated assembly-line work. Now, researchers
    are beginning to see that artificial intelligence, robotics and new disruptive
    technology are challenging white-collar professions that previously seemed invulnerable.\r\n\r\nLook
    at FedEx. \"They hope that by 2020 they will have a pilot center with three or
    four pilots that fly the FedEx fleet [of hundreds of planes] around the country,\"
    said Frank Tobe, editor and publisher of <em>The Robot Report</em>, a publication
    that tracks and analyzes the robot industry. Or there's education. \"I invested
    in one company that uses robots to teach mathematics in schools,\" said Dmitry
    Grishin, CEO of Russian tech giant Mail.Ru Group and head of robotics VC firm
    Grishin Robots.\r\n\r\nWhich raises the question: Will pushing labor onto machines
    open a new bright future for humanity, or a new variation on the Terminator series:
    Rule of the Robot Overlords?\r\n\r\nHere are five professional jobs already being
    replaced by computers, robots, and AI.\r\n\r\n </div>\";s:15:\"images_mirrored\";i:1;}"
