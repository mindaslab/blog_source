<p>Due to latest discoveries, the astronomical community is upbeat about the 9th planet in solar system. Well this planet takes 15,000 - 20,000 years to orbit the Sun. Polimer TV which is a Tamilian channel reported wrong about its orbit. It said the planet talkes 20 million years to orbit the Sun. Fuck! Fuck!! Fuck Polimer. Damn.</p>
<p>Why can't TamilianÂ  news channels report well on Science? Just why can't these Tamilian channels in India have good scientific reporting https://77minds.wordpress.com/2016/04/03/tamilian-news-channels-are-stupid-in-sci-tech/</p>
