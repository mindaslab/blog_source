<p>History repeats itself they say. Thats because we humans are greedy, it drives us till resource becomes scares, there is a great depression or something or a war, then we human gets sober, start to live well, get prosperous, start to think we are God, then we behave like drunk to start all process once again.</p>
<p>But I have found a very strange coincidence here. For the second time German's action will save India. Germany is going all out solar. In my blogs seized by Tamilnadu police (just because I wrote about their harassment of an old man) I said <a href="http://karthikeyanblogs.wordpress.com/2011/06/13/why-india-must-have-strong-solar-energy-policy/" target="_blank">India needs strong solar energy policy .</a> India for about 60 years has suffered very weak leadership. Our leaders primarily reliedÂ  on USSR and USA for guidance. If USA says it wants cheap labor, India readily made easy for its students to goto USA. USA said oil and fossil fuel is the thing and India readily obeyed it.</p>
<p>USA is not a country thats controlled by its citizens they simply vote and thats it. All its policies are framed by the rich arms dealers, bankers, energy industry and blah blah. Just because the energy Industry can make heck money from oil, USA which could easily opt out of oil economy is allying with Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p>Saudi Arabia is a country with very old values. Believe it or not, its illegal for girls to drive cars in that nation. They still think Kuran is the thing and use their oil wealth to sponsor terrorism. India is one country that is hit by terrorist force trained by Pakistan with Saudi money.</p>
<p>By moving out f oil, into renewable, Germany is pulling money that will go to these terrorists and Pakistan (a friend of Saudi Arabia). Thus its saving India. Plus if India gets guidance from Germany, it too can come out of its oil reliance. Availability of solar power in India is really good. But it all depends on USA nod weather India can move out of oil or not. Possibly Narendra Modi, like Vajpyee will be defiant against the threat of USA.</p>
<p>Okay when was the first time Germany saved India? It wad the time when Adolf Hitler launched a campaign to invade Briton. It sparked a debate among the Britons. If they want to fight for their freedom, then whats wrong for Indians to fight for theirs? Without Hitler India's freedom would have been hugely delayed or may never have taken place.</p>
<p>So somehow Germany's action is once again saving India. That time from the Colonizers Briton, this time from the blind Capitalistic system of USA and from our terrorist neighbor Pakistan.</p>
