<p>Wondering how many of you use diaspora (D*)? Its a facebook like social networking app, completely<a href="http://fsf.org" target="_blank"> free software</a>. Though many Keralites use it, in Tamilnadu the adoption is low. infact many people haven't even heard about this technology.</p>
<p>Believe it or not, I have more friends on my D* than my twitter and facebook friends combined. And by some means they seem more close to  me than the people I know AFK, because D* people share my atheistic and anarchist mentality. In other words, diaspora helped me to find people with same mentality.</p>
<p>Diaspora is privacy aware, you can delete your entire account which feature facebook lacks. You can chat with  a girlfriend, completely hidden from another one on the same network, its really secure. Diaspora does not promote cheap publicity like facebook where if a guy logs in  a series of girls are shown as potential friends, and vice versa for girls. Diaspora is democratic, we discuss what should be in it here <a href="https://www.loomio.org/g/EseV9p4X/diaspora-community" target="_blank">https://www.loomio.org/g/EseV9p4X/diaspora-community</a></p>
