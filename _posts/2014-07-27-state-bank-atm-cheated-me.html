<p>Currently I work in K.K Nagar. There is a State Bank Of Mysore near my office and I went there one day to draw money. I punched in an amount and got the money. Back at the office I counted it and to my dismay I found Rs 100/- was missing. I was bewildered.</p>
<p>I don't like humans. Humans are good at management, they have a desire to succeed and hence cheat to take a short path. They put 100's of laws to keep strong strong and weak weak. Humans cheat a lot that's okay for me. I have come to love computers because they are extremely faithful in right hands. Coming back to the State Bank ATM, I don't know if it has fallen into wrong hands or it was a random mistake?</p>
<p>I called State Bank customer care and they offered no help. They said since I used HDFC bank card I had to complain there. HDFC too let me down. An operator said she will take a complain but left me for 7 minutes playing some stupid music. I cut the line in disgust.</p>
<p>I don't know if any of you people have suchÂ  a bad experience, but this is the truth. Either banks have programmed ATM's to cheat once in a while or they have faulty ATM's at their premises and don't want to take complaints about them.</p>
