<p>Today BSNL blocked outgoing calls from my mobile 9444018524. Actually I have very high mobile budget cap. Its high enough that I can talk for 2 months without even worrying about bill, and then pay. This time though its blocked.</p>
<p>I even paid bills that needn't be paid for now, but still the block exist. So the problem isn't money. The irony is BSNL has blocked its customer care numbers too. Now how can I know whats the problem and how can I report the problem even if customer care numbers are blocked?</p>
<p>Why BSNL is so stupid? After Modi I thought it would improve but BSNL is still the same, probably gone worst as this has never happened before for me, I think i am using the number for 11 years. I want to switch.</p>
