    class=\"reblogged-content\">\n\nHere in our house we keep our plants on the threshold
    of death. They are in constant limbo as we remember to water them every few months.
    It is really quite disgraceful.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_987\" align=\"alignnone\"

    data-rehosted=\"1\"> Our sad sad plant.[/caption]\n\nOne day I looked at our plants
    and thought we needed to do something. Go and water them? The plant doesn't just
    need water. It is suffering from the systemic problem of us never remembering
    to water it. No. Watering the plant would be too easy, we need a technological
    solution that will hydrate the plant <strong>and</strong> not require us to change
    our comfortable habit of neglect.\n\nI googled \"automated house plant watering\"
    and the first link that comes up is an <a href=\"http://www.instructables.com/id/Cheap-and-Easy-Automatic-House-Plant-Watering-Syst/\">instructable</a>.
    It promised to be a cheap and easy project. So I went ahead and got all the materials:
    an aquarium air pump, some tubing and valves. I then followed the instructions
    and assembled the parts as they describe. The result was underwhelming. I got
    some gurgling at the plant end of the tube, not a steady or measurable flow. I
    really don't understand the physics that makes that system work, but it has a
    lot to do with water pressure: the deeper your reservoir the more efficient the
    water gets pumped. As the water gets consumed, the pump gives less output. So
    to get an optimal plant-watering we would need to make sure the tank is always
    full. Whats the point of automating it if you have to fill the tank after every
    watering?? This won't do. I plan to put this on a timer. I need to know that if
    I have it on for 1 minute I will always pump a comparable amount of water to the
    plant.\n\nSo I got to thinking, how can an air pump pump water? Specifically,
    how can it pump water with a constant pressure? I came up with this schematic:\n\n[caption

    data-rehosted=\"1\"> Air is pumped into a sealed jar with an outlet tube that
    relieves the jar's pressure by pushing water out through another tube![/caption]\n\nI
    grabbed a mason jar and drilled two 3/16\" holes in the lid. This allowed me to
    insert the two air tube which are slightly thicker (5mm). They fit snuggly and
    formed a seal.\n\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1087\" src=\"https://77minds.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/p1070577.jpg\"

    data-rehosted=\"1\">\n\nNext I attached one of the tubes to the pump, and placed
    the second one's end in a glass. Turned on the pump and! Yes! It works! Science!
    I was getting a steady flow of water. The jar was emptied in a constant rate.
    This setup will do. I'm so pleased with this!\n\nI splurged and got a slightly
    more expensive pump with 4 outputs so I can water 4  plants individually.\n\n<img

    data-rehosted=\"1\">\n\nThis setup has a few advantages over other pump setups:\n<ul>\n<li>It
    is cheap. So far the bill of parts is around $12.50.</li>\n\t<li>It offers predictable
    water throughput.</li>\n\t<li>You can connect any sealable container. Don't want
    to refill the water after 32oz of watering? Get a gallon jug.</li>\n\t<li>If the
    reservoir runs dry the motor won't catch fire. That apparently is a thing water
    pumps.</li>\n\t<li>Since the water is only going through a simple tube and not
    an expensive motor, you can pump a nutrient solution. If you want to pamper your
    plants, we don't.</li>\n</ul>\nI made a stupid pump. Why is that cool? Because
    with a WiFi plug it becomes smart! It is now a Connected Device™. I plugged it
    into a Bayit WiFi socket, and set it to turn on for 20 seconds each Monday afternoon.
    That will feed our plants about a 1/2 a cup a week. If we like the results we
    may extend it to a full cup!\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_1098\" align=\"alignnone\"

    WiFi Sockets</strong>\n\nThey suck. They take the simplest operation of closing
    a circuit and abstract it in a shitty smartphone app that only works half the
    time. Well, at least that has been my impression with this Bayit gadget. For my
    next project I am going to use a Kankun smart plug. Apparently it runs OpenWRT
    and is very hackable.\n<h3>Bill of Materials</h3>\n<table border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<colgroup
