<p>They wanted me to become a medicine man. Doctors they said are highly respected in society. I had other plans. People wanted me to become a lawyer as I had good ability to speak and was able to think better. I avoided it. Even today I avoid many leader ship and controlling positions.</p>
<p>Why? Lets say that some one is ill, their life is in in  the hands off doctor. That power could be abused and its been abused today. Rather than serving humanity, doctors caught in the world of capitalism want to milk money because their patients fear painful  life or death. The same is the case of lawyers, one who is convicted in court must trust his life on  a lawyer. Same is the case of accountant too, your financial future and your companies financial statement are in his hands.</p>
<p>I have a strong feeling that one human has no rights to control another, and so I took Electronics and Communication Engineering. How on earth an engineer can control the life of others I thought. What a stupid I was. Contrary to my expectation, everywhere I go I had to take decisions that controls the life of others. I am getting involved in politics. I am unable to indulge in science which is pure and sane and am forced to indulge with humans who have all evils in them. To make matters worst I live in a age where capitalism and greed prevails. Man is working for money and material than the other way around.</p>
<p>I had to suspect people, take decisions that would hurt them, remove smile from their faces, truth turns an innocent child into a adult with evils in him. Who knows how many tears have been shed because of me? Who knows how many people feel let down and cheated because of me? who knows how many innocent people have I misjudged as evil though they are real angels?</p>
<p>Would one day there would be a world where no one is controlled by any other? I wonder what would destroy Satan in human hearts and install compassionate God in them?</p>
