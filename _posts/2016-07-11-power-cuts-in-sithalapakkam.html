<p>Monday 11 July 2016 11:35:11 PM IST, Sithalapakkam</p>
<p>Sitting in my home, I am typing this blog in dark, well now the power came. My doubt is, why we are having power cuts. Yesterday I was watching Maalai Murasu T.V which was saying that Tamilnadu is producing excess power and is exporting power to Goa. Well, then why I have powercuts? Today there seem to be four powercuts at my home.</p>
<p>The weather is breezy, then are they cutting power because of the weather? Afraid that winds might cause the lines to cutt and fall down? I am not sure. Then when it is breezy in Poes Garden, is power in Jayalalithaas home getting cut too?</p>
<p>After all Jayalalitha is my servant, I pay her. I wonder how she could sleep well when her master is in dark? Wonder what heck work she and her predecessor Karunanidhi had done?</p>
<p>They say this and that. Though power situation has improved, why am I getting power cuts when I pay my bills properly? And when I can't sleep, how the heck and who gave the right for my servants and former servants to sleep well?</p>
