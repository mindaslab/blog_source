<blockquote><p>Our education system infuses a thought of superiority and inferiority that ruins our intellect. That must change.</p></blockquote>
<p>I lead a team in my company, possibly the best skilled and disciplined team my company has now. I am proud of them. My lead technique is simple, let my team have common sense and cultivate the brain of their own. Once they can think enough, all I need to do is to pass high level instructions and watch youtube.</p>
<p>But there are some "what the fuck" movements. My team knows very well I care nothing about their personal traits, only their professionalism is what I am bothered about.</p>
<p>And here is first what the fuck. One of my team mate asked me permission so that he could go out for 5 minutes. WHAT!!!!! Why should I care weather he goes out for 5 minutes or a century?! I am trying to build a team on anarchist principle where people manage themselves and then this one happens out of the blue.</p>
<p>Another incident happened where one of my colleague asked me permission to go early. I have never ever laid out timings for my team, and this one stunned me, more stunning was he gave me a reason why he wants to leave early. For a person who has strict rule not to indulge in peoples personal reasons this was kind of a stunner.</p>
<p>In India, even in an intellectual industry like information technology people have the sense of superiority and inferiority, thats stupid, that clearly points to the lack of intellect in the organization. I must infuse more of independent thought into my team and make them more formidable thinking force that does things other teams never would have dreamed of. Till then I am failure.</p>
<p>Any way here is the Zeroth what the fuck. Long time ago, a head weight manager once pulled my team mate and tortured him jut because she saw him playing games, any way I roasted her and am waiting to roast her more when opportunity is available (i.e when her head wight grows again). None messes up with me.</p>
