Sadhguru Jaggi Vasudev either a fool or a con man. Recently he seemed to have launched a project to grow trees. Well isn't that good? Ummmm, smells fishy as he is posing himself as some one who care about nature and environment. Why because of this...

This Jaggi has a huge ashram in Coimbatore and it covers lot of hectares, but what land it was? It was a land that had lot of frees and was kinda forest people say. It was also a path which was used by elephants to cross.

Well this is BJP rule, a blind Hindu government means its a good times for conman like Jaggi and he was able to acquire the land somehow and the environment ministry seems to have given a nod for his ashram.

Having bashed trees, and having disrupted the movements of elephants and as though he is super innocent now he is posing himself to launch a new project to plant trees. Wouldn't it be better for him to close his ashram and let nature take over?
