<p dir="ltr">In the morning wife asked for newspaper ..<br />
Husband - how backward are you....world had progressed so much and you are asking for news paper? Here, have my TAB ....</p>
<p dir="ltr">Wife killed the cockroach with the TAB....</p>
<p dir="ltr">Husband unconscious ...<img class="CToWUd" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/1f633" alt="😳" /></p>
<p dir="ltr">Moral-<br />
Whatever wife asks...,give</p>
<p dir="ltr">Golden Words......</p>
<p dir="ltr">1. "If you want to change the world, do it when you are a bachelor. After marriage, you can't even change a TV channel"</p>
<p dir="ltr">2. "Listening to wife is like reading the terms and conditions of website. You understand Nothing, still you agreed..."</p>
<p dir="ltr">3. "Chess is the only game in the world, which reflects the status of the husband. The poor King can take only one step at a time...While the mighty Queen can do whatever she likes."</p>
<p dir="ltr">4. "All men are brave. Horror movies don't scare them...But 5 missed calls from wife...surely dead..."</p>
<p dir="ltr">Send this to all men who can smile after reading this... &amp; to all ladies who can LOL after reading it.</p>
