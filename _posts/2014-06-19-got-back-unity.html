<p>You have to really miss something to know how much you love it. Truth to be told, I have never ever missed by ex-girlfriends, though I just spend time mum a week, I am very thankful that they are no more in my life. But it happened one day that after a Ubuntu update my Unity desktop crashed. With the help of my friend I installed Gnome and was using it.</p>
<p>Gnome is good, but as time progressed, I was missing sleek Unity. It was kind of heart breaking. Thankfully today withÂ  a determination to end this issue and get back my unity, I searched and got this page http://askubuntu.com/questions/17610/how-do-i-reset-my-unity-configuration , and thank goodness. This page helped me to reset unity with Ubuntu tweak tool and my desktop is back! Yaay!</p>
