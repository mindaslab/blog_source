    class=\"reblogged-content\">\n\nThe article <a href=\"http://hackaday.com/2014/12/15/home-computers-behind-the-iron-curtain/\">Home
    Computers Behind the Iron Curtain</a>Â sparked a lot of interest, which made me
    very happy. Therefore, I decided to introduce more computer curiosities from the
    Iron Curtain period, especially from the former Czechoslovakia (CSSR).\r\n\r\nAs
    I mentioned in the previous article, the lack of spare parts, literature and technology
    in Czechoslovakia forced geeks to solve it themselves: by improvisation and what
    we wouldÂ todayÂ call \"hacking.\" Â Hobbyist projects of one person or a small
    party was eventually taken over by a state-owned enterprise, which then began
    to manufacture and deliver to stores with some minor modifications. These projects
    most often involved a variety of peripherals thatÂ could only be found in theÂ Czechoslovakia
    with great difficulty.\r\n\r\nMuch like the production of components, the production
    of peripherals was also distributed throughout the eastern block so that each
    country was specializing in certain types of peripherals. For example, East Germany
    produced matrix printers, and Bulgaria made floppy disks drives. This meantÂ industrial
    enterprises had to wait for vital computer parts, because the production in another
    country was not sufficient to cover even the local requirements, let alone the
    home user.\r\n\r\n<!--more-->\r\n<h2 class=\"western\">BT-100</h2>\r\nIf you had
    brought a computer like aÂ Spectrum or Atari from the west without a printer,
    you had almost no chance to get one in the CSSR. You would manage to scavenge
    some discarded matrix printer through your network of friends, but then you stumbled
    upon the need of connecting it through non-standard interfaces and coding drivers
    for it. You would consider yourself lucky when the printer used a Centronics interface
    and standard Epson control codes. Therefore, various attempts arose to build a
    printer at home. You think that's impossible?\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_152581\"

    data-rehosted=\"1\"> Centrum T-85. Image schotek.cz[/caption]\r\n\r\nIn larger
    cities, clubs s formed, covered officially by the only national youth organization,
    but they were mostly free of any ideology. They congregated modelers, electrical
    engineers, computer enthusiasts and other tech lovers. These clubs often had better
    ways to obtain some of the technology or more expensive devices. In one such a
    club, the one-dot printer Centrum T85 was born. After several modifications to
    the mechanical parts and electronics, Tesla (an electronics manufacturer mentioned
    in the previous article) began its production under the name of BT-100.\r\n\r\nThe
    BT-100 was a very simple printer, which consisted of two motors and one relay.
    One motor rotated a pinch roller and pushed the sheet of paper, the other one
    pushed a trolley with a print head which had an electromagnetically controlled
    blunt tip. The tip rode across the paper left and right and clicked into the paper
    to print a dot. The printer also had two wheels with notches which generated synchronization
    pulses.\r\n\r\nThe printer did not use any ribbons. Printing was achieved by placing
    a sheet of paper along with the carbon copy paper under the rollers. An imprint
    was made on the paper where the print tip clicked. This printing technology has
    given rise to a fitting nickname \"runaway nail\".\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_152582\"

    data-rehosted=\"1\"> The underside of the BT-100 printer. Image from nostalcomp.cz[/caption]\r\n\r\nThe
    internal wiring of the printer was really primitive: 3 motors drives, excitation
    coil for pulling of the print tip and optoelectronic sensors to offset the paper,
    carriage and range. The interface used four input signals (carriage left, carriage
    right, paper feed and tip pulling) and four output signals (signal range, offset
    paper pulse sensor and two pulse head movement sensors). The interface truly was
    extremely simple and all of the work was offloaded to the control program.\r\n\r\nThe
    printer could print unidirectionally orÂ bidirectionally (it took about 10 minutes
    to print one A4 paper, or 20 minutes with unidirectional printing). Even though
    the printer itself was a technological hack, it was modified even further by its
    users. They increased the speed of head movement, added notches to increase the
    printing accuracy (without these adjustments it had a resolution of 480 dots per
    line, therefore approximately 60 DPI) and made other adjustments to increase the
    speed and print quality. As a curiosity I will mention a program which had spread
    over Czechoslovakia - it was able to elicit a simple melody from the printer by
    using precisely timed controlling.\r\n\r\nThis printer certainly was not the best
    toolÂ to print a source code or any documentation. It managed to print just a
    few pages at a time, and even that took tens of minutes:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cwn8_0KPTo\r\n\r\nA
    similar printer called Gamacentrum 01 used a slightly different design. It was
    equipped with two printing tips (two \"nails\") on one print head, spaced at a
    distance of half a page between each other. During printing, each tip printed
    a half of the page. The print quality was only slightly higher than that of BT-100,
    while the printer still cost three times as much.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxaaaTCUS3k\r\n<h2
    class=\"western\">Alfi</h2>\r\nAround 1925 in the former Czechoslovak Republic
    a kit for children was created, based on connecting perforated metal sheets with
    screws and nuts. This kit was called <a href=\"http://www.merkurtoys.cz/en/\">Merkur</a>.
    Later in the 60s it was being exported throughout the Europe and several generations
    (without exaggeration) of children in Czechoslovakia had grown up with it. The
    kit is easily accessible, while allowing to assemble almost anything with a plenty
    of imagination. The inventor of contact lenses [<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otto_Wichterle\">Otto
    Wichterle</a>]Â created his first prototypes on a centrifuge, <a href=\"http://www.merkurtoys.cz/wichterleho-cockostroj-z-merkuru\">which
    was made from this kit</a>.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_152586\" align=\"alignleft\"

    data-rehosted=\"1\"> A plotter made from Merkur. Image from merkurtoys.cz[/caption]\r\n\r\nIn
    the 80s an engineer VladimÃ­r Doval built a simple plotter from this kit and called
    it Alfi. Its structure was somewhat more sophisticated than the above-mentioned
    BT-100. The author used two stepper motors (one for paper feed, the other to move
    the pen) and electromagnetically controlled lowering of the pen. Assembly instructions
    were then published in a magazine of â\x80\x9CScience and technology for youthâ\x80\x9D
    (VTM), and shortly after these plotters began to appear on the of tables Czechoslovak
    computer enthusiasts who rummaged through their attics, looking for dusty boxes
    with their childhood kit. A simple interface was used to connect the plotter,
    built mostly with a 8255 circuit.\r\n\r\nAlfi was not confined to the drawing
    pen - some even used home-built optical pens and created primitive scanners. Alfi
    was indeed very simple, as it was again fully reliant on computer software, but
    the quality was very decent - speed of 50 mm per second and minimum step of 0.15
    mm.\r\n\r\nAlfi plotter lives to this day, as you can see in this video: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBip6q0qjDk\"><span
    style=\"color:#1155cc;\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBip6q0qjDk</span></span></a>\r\n\r\nIf
    you did not want to build a plotter yourself, you had several options at the end
    of the 80s. You could, for example, buy a plotter Minigraf 0507 (manufactured
    by Aritma) or series XY41xx plotters (manufactured by Laboratory equipment). They
    offered more or less the same performance as Alfi, and the top model XY4160 contained
    its own processor and understood the HPGL language.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmSXX1-Q-wg\r\n<h2
    class=\"western\">SP210T</h2>\r\nIn the previous article I already mentioned that
    floppy disks weren't among the usual stock in a socialist market. Floppy drives
    were produced mainly in Bulgaria and their production was definitely not enough
    to meet demand. In Czechoslovakia they largely belonged to industrial computers
    and the \"home\" computer category had to settle for an ordinary cassette tape.\r\n\r\nDespite
    this, many diverse floppy drives emerged. For example, a school computer IQ-151
    was assembled with a 8\" floppy drive (aka â\x80\x9Cteacherâ\x80\x99s computerâ\x80\x9D)
    and a network of several other computers (â\x80\x9Cstudentâ\x80\x99s computersâ\x80\x9D)
    were connected to it. They had a clone of CP/M on them, along with WordStar text
    editor and a Pascal compiler. Later, after the regime fell and imports from the
    world were permitted and renewed, a mass-produced drives as well as other computers
    were created.\r\n\r\nOnly some of the lucky ones brought a floppy drive (usually
    Commodore) from the West countries for their computers. The others obtained or
    built a Spectrum Betadisk. Its custom interface was not much of a problem, because
    instructions got published in the magazines, but the drive itself was hard to
    get a hold of, you would need an acquaintance or bring it from abroad yourself.\r\n\r\nThe
    most common peripheral remained a cassette recorder for a long time, and a lot
    of those among the people have various provenance and quality, ranging from weird
    plastic experiments to almost professional pieces. Tesla could show off their
    own cassette deck SM260, which had a surprisingly decent design and that was certainly
    an exception for Czechoslovak electronic devices at that time. Tesla then modified
    their cassette deck, removed power parts of the amplifier, and the result was
    a \"data recorder\" SP210. It had the same structure, but a slightly different
    design: the front part received speakers, the tape recorder contained a microphone
    through which you could make a preamble of the recording, and it was even possible
    to receive control from a computer directly using a simple TTL interface, including
    rewinding and recording. There was even a module which allowed the computer SAPI-1
    to use SP210 as a recording device for CP/M.\r\n\r\nAnd since the removal of the
    audio bits left a relatively large space unused inside, the creator thought to
    incorporate the previously mentioned printer BT-100 into that space. Thus a model
    SP-210T was created.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_152587\" align=\"aligncenter\"

    created a very surreal hybrid between a cassette tape SP210 and the BT-100 printer,
    and called it SP210T. The SP210TÂ had a recording device and printer combined
    into one device. What the West wouldÂ consider a curiosity was in Czechoslovakia
    a serious product. This printer had been gradually connected to nearly every computer
    in Czechoslovakia, ranging from ZX Spectrum and Atari to the Czechoslovak PMD-85
    computer.\r\n\r\nBut the SP210T was not the last word in technology with the same
    design: In 1990, production began on a floppy drive PMD-32 (as the name suggests,
    it was a peripheral of the PMD-85) - again, in the same box as the SP-210T. It
    contained two 5.25â\x80\x9D drives, controller based on FDC i8227 and DMA i8257
    and a control circuit, where all the work was taken care of by a 8080 processor.
    The PMD computer communicated using an interface based on 8255 circuit.\r\n<h2
    class=\"western\">Computer Mouse</h2>\r\nThe creators of this homebrew computer
    mouseÂ rightly thought that the mouse is nothing too difficult. It's just a ball
    that transmits its movement to vertical rollers, and this movement somehow gets
    measured. They sat down and put together their own mouse, which kind of resembles
    a feverish handymanâ\x80\x99s dream. Judge for yourself:\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_152283\"
    align=\"alignleft\" width=\"350\"]<img class=\"wp-image-152283 size-full\" src=\"https://77minds.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/mouse2-1.jpg\"

    data-rehosted=\"1\"> The roller ball of a homemade mouse. It's a ping pong ball.[/caption]\r\n\r\nAs
    housing for the mouse they used plastic kitchen spice can. Inside the can they
    placed a circuit board on which were two mutually perpendicular metal rollers.
    On both rollers there was a jagged aperture made from a thick paper. Its position
    was read using a LED and a pair of phototransistors. There were two buttons at
    the front. Each button was created from a cap screw and a pair of shortened and
    bent safety pins. (Why? Well, because micro switchesÂ were unobtainable for a
    long time in Czechoslovakia!) The ball, an important part of the mouse, was replaced
    by a ping-pong ball. The cable was made as an interweaving of eight wires.\r\n\r\nAll
    of this was manufactured and supplied as a kit. You could buy it in the store
    and then assemble at home. <a href=\"http://sam.speccy.cz/olddocs/mys602_navod_ke_stavbe.pdf\">Here
    is a construction manual</a> (PDF, in Czech).\r\n\r\nThe most serious enthusiasts
    used ingenious ways to fill the ping-pong ball with heavy ballast for better fit
    and movement transmission.\r\n\r\nThis peripheralÂ was Â very simple and acceded
    to some parallel interface. The rest had to be taken care by the software. The
    proprietary driver, a program that has been supplied with this kit used interrupts
    for determining the positions of apertures. And since interrupts on the Spectrum
    had a frequency of 50 Hz, it meant that the scanning was imprecise during faster
    mouse movements. Therefore, the authors suggested the use of a certain diagram,
    which increased the frequency of interruptions.\r\n\r\nThere have been perhaps
    5000 of these kits created, which is a huge number in the Czechoslovak situation
    where computer accessories for small computers were produced in a series of several
    hundred.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignleft wp-image-152282 size-full\" src=\"https://77minds.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/mouse1-1.jpg\"
    alt=\"mouse1 (1)\" width=\"350\" height=\"286\" data-originalSrc=\"https://hackadaycom.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/mouse1-1.jpg\"
    data-rehosted=\"1\">I got my mouse in a little curious way: Sometime in 1988,
    the Czechoslovak authorities have decided to support young people working with
    computers, and so the idea of an international game was born. A text game City
    Of Robots was made, which was then ported to several platforms (Spectrum, PMD-85,
    IQ-151, Sharp MZ-800 and Ondra) and was distributed to interested parties on tape.
    To make sure everyone had the same conditions, the game required a password, which
    was to be announced at a specified date in the main news broadcast on a state
    television.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, due to authors mistake, the password could be
    read in a binary file, so it has spread throughout Czechoslovakia before the game
    even started. And on that particular day in the news the announcer said this unfortunate
    password (it was \"konvalinka\", or â\x80\x9Clilyâ\x80\x9D in English) and added
    \"for those who do not know it yet\". And because there werenâ\x80\x99t even conditions
    for everyone, the winners were drawn, and I received the mouse kit as a prize.\r\n\r\nCzechoslovakia
    also manufactured computer mice, of course, at the very end of 80â\x80\x99s, like
    <a href=\"http://www.sapi.cz/prislusenstvi/3wn16607.php\">3WN16605/16607</a>.\r\n<h2>In
    Conclusion</h2>\r\nCreating peripherals for home 8-bit computers and their small
    batch production in Czechoslovakia after the fall of the Iron Curtain lasted until
    the early 90s. With the collapse of socialism it was possible to produce these
    accessories legally, so new manufacturers seized the opportunity and began to
    supply larger series of universal interfaces with an <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_8255\">IntelÂ 8255</a>
    or audio peripherals such as the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Instrument_AY-3-8910\">General
    InstrumentÂ AY-3-8912</a> or the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philips_SAA1099\">Philips
    SAA-1099</a>. But the opening of the border also meant an invasion of PCs, tech
    enthusiasts switched to Amiga, and eight-bit era slowly ended...\r\n\r\nI certainly
    did not describe all former peripherals that were made or homemade in Czechoslovakia.
    We can introduce other computer curiosities of the \"socialist bloc\" some other
    time - from the joystick built from doorbell buttons to the clone of ZX Spectrum,
    where the circuit ULA was replaced by several dozen of standard TTL 74xx series
    chips...\r\n\r\n<hr>\n<h2>About The Author</h2>\r\n<a href=\"https://77minds.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/ek35_maly3_ren_volf_k.jpg\"><img
