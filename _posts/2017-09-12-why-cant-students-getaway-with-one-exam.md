I was finishing up 12th, but that was not just it. I took on computer science group,
I had the vision to become a electrical engineer. The funny thing is though I
studied hard for my 12th exam and got decent marks, it was not enough. I had
to take exams to get into Engineering course. I then wondered why can't I take an exam
straight for engineering degree and avoid 12th or why can't people be smart enough
do design exams in such a way that if you have passed 12th you are qualified to
get engineering?

If someone eyed for medicine or engineering, then they must take 3 exams. One for
12th, another for medicine entrance and other for engineering entrance. In this
modern world where people are getting stressed because so much is put on their
shoulders, I truly wonder why there must be so many exams?

I feel education system in India and possibly in most  of industrialized countries
are broken, and I feel the world looks qualified enough but is not educated enough
to realize that its mostly made up of stupid people and they are the ones who are
controlling us.
