    class=\"reblogged-content\">\n\n[tc_dropcap]The Apple Watch is now on the wrists
    of members of the general public for the first time, and opinions about its usefulness
    are flying fast and furious.[/tc_dropcap]\r\n\r\nHere at TechCrunch, we've been
    sharing our thoughts in <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2015/04/24/apple-watch-diary/\">an
    ongoing diary</a>, featuring daily entries describing what it's like to use the
    Watch as we become more familiar with the new gadget.\r\n\r\nNow, though, after
    over a week with the Watch, here's a more cohesive look at how my thoughts on
    the wearable computer and its place in my life have jelled. This review should give
    you a more direct answer to the question, \"Should I buy one?\"\r\n<h1>Video Review</h1>\r\n[tc_aol_on

    hardware design</li>\r\n\t<li>Basic features offer instant utility</li>\r\n</ul>\n<h2>Cons</h2>\r\n<ul>\n<li> More
    advanced features are less than intuitive</li>\r\n</ul>\n<h1></h1>\r\n<h1>Design</h1>\r\nThe
    Apple Watch is a design feat, no matter how you look at it. The construction of
    the case, and the attention to detail paid to elements like the digital crown
    and strap connector are outstanding. In general, the feel of the Watch on the
    wrist is way beyond anything that anyone else making smartwatches has so far produced.\r\n\r\n[gallery
    ids=\"449,450,451,452,453,454,455\"]\r\n\r\nSome of the standout design features
    of the Watch include the weight of the case, which is substantial enough to satisfy
    a regular watch-wearer like myself without feeling burdensome. The aluminum models
    feel featherweight by comparison, which just goes to show that Apple took into
    account a range of user comfort-levels and experience with wrist-worn accessories;
    for my money, though, the substance and perceptible density of the stainless steel
    Watch collection is where it's at.\r\n\r\n[tc_writerquote align=\"right\"]The
    Apple Watch is a design feat, no matter how you look at it.[/tc_writerquote]\r\n\r\nMy
    review unit came with the white flourelastomer sport band, which proved surprisingly
    comfortable, and easy enough to get on and off the wrist once you get used to
    its unique pin-and-tuck clasp mechanism. Said mechanism ends up being much better
    than a standard strap, in fact, because the tucked portion acts as a shim to snug
    up fit comfortably, and you don't have that tail end hanging off the way it often
    can.\r\n\r\nGenerally, I've been wearing the Apple Watch from when I wake up to
    when I go to bed, with nary a break in between (except to shower), and the Sport
    Band's comfort-oriented design really shines with this kind of use. I'll go from
    using it at my computer to hitting the road for a run, then simply rinse it down
    quickly in the bathroom sink before it hits my wrist again, and so far, it's been
    nothing but a pleasure to wear in all these different settings.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter
    size-full wp-image-1151078 img-full\" src=\"https://77minds.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/apple-watch-bg.jpg\"
    alt=\"apple-watch-bg\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" data-originalSrc=\"https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/apple-watch-bg.jpg\"
    data-rehosted=\"1\">\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the black leather loop bracelet
    has been more of a mixed bag. This strap option, also supplied by Apple for the
    purposes of this review, closes thanks to magnetic segments that attach to one
    another, surrounded by a sealed external skin of leather. The leather extends
    all the way to the connector component at the end of the strap, making this a
    versatile option for those looking for something that matches both aluminum and
    stainless steel case options, so in that regard it's a good general choice.\r\n\r\nOverall,
    I'm satisfied with the band and will definitely continue to use it, but it does
    have a tendency to slip somewhat looser when you bend your wrist, as the magnets
    slide against each other and drop down a couple of links, meaning you'll find
    yourself readjusting throughout the day. It doesn't happen that often (only when
    my wrist bends at a fairly dramatic angle from my forearm) but it's just enough
    to ensure the leather loop strap isn't strictly a set-it-and-forget it option
    once it's on your arm.\r\n<h1>Features</h1>\r\n<h2>Digital Crown</h2>\r\nDisclaimer:
    I'm a sucker for knobs and dials. These elements remind me of the mechanical and
    automatic watches that I love, and Apple's design team was clearly on the same
    page when they came up with the Digital Crown.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter
    size-full wp-image-1151080 img-full\" src=\"https://77minds.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/digital-crown-watch.jpg\"
    alt=\"digital-crown-watch\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" data-originalSrc=\"https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/digital-crown-watch.jpg\"
    data-rehosted=\"1\">\r\n\r\nApple's crown takes the traditional watch crown as
    its primary design influence, but the function it serves is quite different. A
    regular watch's crown lets you set the time, date (if you have such a complication)
    and, in the case of mechanical watches, wind it to build up a reserve of energy
    to power the movement of the hands. Apple's Digital Crown allows for a very different
    kind of input, controlling scrolling primarily, and acting as one of two physical
    buttons on the Watch when you press down on the top.\r\n\r\nUsing the Digital
    Crown is pleasant, and offers a lot of tactile satisfaction, with the proviso
    that you do have to take some time to get used to it. It's <em>very</em> responsive,
    and as such, can feel a bit fiddly at first. I think I was used to having to perform
    more exaggerated gestures with devices that serve similar functions on the desktop,
    like the mouse scroll wheel, which meant having to get used to the Digital Crown's
    fine-tuned level of heightened motion sensitivity.\r\n<h2>Force Touch</h2>\r\nUsing
    Force Touch (pressing down more firmly on the watch than is required for basic
    taps) to expand your control options is another Apple Watch feature that isn't
    instantly apparent, but that quickly becomes second nature when using the gadget.
    The reason it takes time to get used to is that it's brand new, appearing only
    on the new 13-inch MBP and 12-inch MacBook in addition to here, and that there
    aren't any visual cues to let you know that you should press down to expose more
    options.\r\n\r\nI quickly found myself Force Touching whenever I encountered a
    road block on the Watch, however. The process went as follows: recall or expect
    some function from a native Watch app that I can't seem to find, Force Touch,
    and in most cases find said function.\r\n\r\n[tc_writerquote align=\"left\"]I
    quickly found myself Force Touching whenever I encountered a road block on the
    Watch.[/tc_writerquote]\r\n\r\nForce Touch also provides moments of light, but
    fun surprise, like when I realized earlier today that you could deep press on
    the color picker in the Digital Touch sketch app to get a color wheel that allows
    you to go beyond the pre-set options. Overall, it's a feature that feels ripe
    with promise, especially once third-party apps get the opportunity to explore
    it further.\r\n<h2>Digital Touch</h2>\r\nThe Digital Touch features of Apple Watch
    are those unique messaging features you've probably heard a lot about, which work
    exclusively watch-to-watch and which allow you to send your friends sketches,
    taps and even an approximation of your heart beat.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter
    size-full wp-image-1151081 img-full\" src=\"https://77minds.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/digital-touch-watch.jpg\"
    alt=\"digital-touch-watch\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" data-originalSrc=\"https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/digital-touch-watch.jpg\"
    data-rehosted=\"1\">\r\n\r\nAt first, as I shared in our Apple Watch experience
    diary, these features seemed primarily novelties that I didn't really see much
    value in. That was due largely to the fact that I had a very small group of potential
    recipients to use Digital Touch with. Sending my lovely boss Matthew Panzarino
    my heartbeat, or goofy sketches and oddly intimate taps was, in a word, weird.\r\n\r\nBut
    it wasn't quite as weird when a couple good friends received their Apple Watch
    units on the first day of availability, and it was far less strange when I picked
    up a 38mm Apple Watch Sport for my girlfriend via an online classified. Long-term,
    based on what I've experienced so far, most Digital Touch features are probably
    going to be used exclusively between myself and her, but that doesn't mean they're
    extraneous to the experience; in contrast, it actually emphasizes just how right
    Tim Cook is to call the Apple Watch its \"most personal device ever.\"\r\n\r\n[tc_writerquote
    align=\"left\"]Sending my boss my heartbeat was weird.[/tc_writerquote]\r\n\r\nWith
    a little work, I could see additions to the current Digital Touch feature set
    making it more appealing for use among a close circle of friends, but for now,
    for me, it's an aspect of the Watch with essentially an audience of one.\r\n<h2>Glances</h2>\r\nBesides
    Notifications, the Apple Watch feature that I use most frequently is without a
    doubt Glances. You access these by swiping up from your watch face, which then
    shows you one of up to 12 single screens complete with information from a corresponding
    companion app on your device. Apple offers a number of stock glances with its
    system software, including Battery, Weather and a Now Playing screen, but third-party
    developers can also populate Glances with info from their own apps.\r\n\r\nI'm
    still tweaking my own selection of Glances, but I generally find myself using
    the Battery and Weather ones most frequently. These just happen to be the pieces
    of information I find most useful beyond system notifications on my Watch, and
    since I don't necessarily like the Battery complication flinging my total remaining
    power in my face all the time, I much prefer keeping it hidden but still close
    at hand.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1151085\" src=\"https://77minds.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/glances.jpg\"
    alt=\"glances\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" data-originalSrc=\"https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/glances.jpg\"
    data-rehosted=\"1\">\r\n\r\nThe Calendar Glance is also clutch for giving you
    a heads-up on any looming appointments and meetings, and in terms of third-party
    apps, I've been greatly enjoying the Air Canada Glance, which actually provides
    an ongoing countdown to your next scheduled flight, provided it's occurring within
    24 hours of when you take a look.\r\n\r\nGlances aren't perfect, however; data
    refresh often takes time, especially when it's fetching the info from third-party
    apps on your iPhone over Bluetooth. But while the Glances implementation something
    that leaves me hopeful for improvements in future versions of Watch OS and with
    future hardware, it's still an essential experience even as-is, and something
    that I'd have a hard time giving up now that I'm used to it.\r\n<h2>Camera Remote</h2>\r\nThis
    native app is worth a separate shout-out since it's such a great feature for those
    who've come to depend on their iPhones as their primary cameras. The Camera Remote
    app from Apple gives you a real-time preview of your smartphones viewfinder on
    your wrist, as well as the ability to tap to choose focus/exposure, and to trigger
    the shutter, or implement a timer followed by a 10-frame burst.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter
    size-full wp-image-1151090 img-full\" src=\"https://77minds.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/camera-remote-apple-watch.jpg\"
    alt=\"camera-remote-apple-watch\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" data-originalSrc=\"https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/camera-remote-apple-watch.jpg\"
    data-rehosted=\"1\">\r\n\r\nIt's a great feature if you want to do anything other
    than point and shoot with your camera, and it's great even just for 'periscoping,'
    or reaching higher heights by extending your arm to get a shot you wouldn't otherwise
    be able to capture. I'm still just starting out in terms of testing the full range
    of what you can accomplish with this and simple accessories like a tabletop iPhone
    tripod, but it's definitely a super cool built-in feature.\r\n<h1>Performance</h1>\r\nThe
    Apple Watch's performance was something that I honestly wasn't expecting to find
    all that impressive, given the consensus from early reviews. And when it comes
    to third-party apps, there's definitely work that needs to be done since funneling
    data from your phone leads to holdups, as you can clearly see in the video review
    above. But overall, the performance of the device was a pleasant surprise, perhaps
    in part because I had low expectations going in.\r\n\r\nIn short, despite some
    disappointing waits for data to load in apps like Instagram, Apple Watch's performance
    is up to snuff for just about every thing you'll likely end up using it for most,
    including activities like checking the time, receiving and triaging notifications,
    and using the native Glance extensions. Below, you can see how it shapes up broken
    down across specific features.\r\n<h2>Phone</h2>\r\nThe Apple Watch is many things,
    but it might be surprising to some to find that it's a great Dick Tracy watch,
    in that the speaker phone functions of the wearable are extremely capable. The
    built-in speaker is clear and loud enough, and the microphone, according to call
    recipients, is also easy to listen to and understand.\r\n\r\nWhere the Watch Phone
    app encounters some issues is in actually being able to field calls consistently,
    as I had a few examples of trying to accept a call on my wrist but not having
    the action register. In the end, though, it's a very handy feature, especially
    if your phone is in your bag - provided you're alone or unconcerned with looking
    a little awkward talking to your wrist on a busy street.\r\n<h2>Siri and Dictation</h2>\r\n<img
    class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1151075\" src=\"https://77minds.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/watch-siri.jpg\"
    alt=\"watch-siri\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" data-originalSrc=\"https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/watch-siri.jpg\"
    data-rehosted=\"1\">\r\n\r\nI seem to be one of the lucky ones for whom Siri works
    almost perfectly in terms of gleaning my intended meaning, and that luck continues
    on the Apple Watch, once the feature is active. The voice prompt of \"Hey Siri\"
    doesn't work all that consistently, activating the feature about two-thirds of
    the times I intend it to, but the Digital Crown long-press is always effective,
    and Siri transcribes my words nearly perfectly once it's active.\r\n\r\nOn the
    iPhone, I don't often find myself using Siri, but it's been a more regularly accessed
    resource on my Apple Watch thus far. Especially in cases where the canned responses
    set by Apple (and customized by myself) are insufficient for replying to messages,
    a quick dictated response has proven immensely useful and almost never disappoints.
    Again, your mileage may vary, but the Siri of Apple Watch may not be the Siri
    you remember if you haven't used the virtual assistant in a while.\r\n<h2>Display</h2>\r\nOne
    of the recurring joys of using the Apple Watch, especially for a gadget fiend
    like myself, is just taking in the quality of that screen. I've used just about
    every Android Wear device on the market, and they honestly don't even compare
    – looking at them now is almost like looking at a VGA display after using a Retina
    iPhone.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1151076 img-full\"
    src=\"https://77minds.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/apple-watch-message-close1.jpg\"
    alt=\"apple-watch-message-close\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" data-originalSrc=\"https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/apple-watch-message-close1.jpg\"
    data-rehosted=\"1\">\r\n\r\nText is so crisp that the size of the font doesn't
    bother me at all, though again, it'll depend on your specific needs here (I dial
    down the system font size on iPhone, for context). It's pretty enough that I always
    now read out the entire email on my wrist when it's plain-text formatted, in fact,
    rather than opening up the Mail app on my iPhone.\r\n<h2>Touch</h2>\r\nTouch is
    very responsive, as you'd expect from the company that changed touch input forever,
    and in general even though touch targets tend to often be small, I had no problems
    in terms of missed or mistaken input (including with the tiny number pad you use
    to input your passcode, where I still expect a miss every time despite myself).\r\n\r\nThere's
    one notable exception to that rule however: Whenever there's a single-line text
    link at the top of the screen to return to a previous page, I have trouble getting
    the Watch to respond to my tap on that consistently. It seems to be limited to
    that specific instance, so it seems likely that Apple can target it for improvement
    in future software updates.\r\n\r\n[tc_writerquote align=\"left\"]Touch is responsive,
    as you'd expect from the company that changed touch input forever.[/tc_writerquote]\r\n\r\nOn
    the whole, response and tap accuracy were great, though, and as an added bonus,
    taptic response when you Force Touch during things like Workouts are great workarounds
    for making a touchscreen device more usable while engaged in more active use.\r\n<h2>Taptic
    Engine</h2>\r\nSpeaking of that Taptic Engine, it's a real game-changer when it
    comes to wearable tech. Apple's take on haptic feedback really does merit a different
    name from what others have offered, because it provides a very different experience.
    Especially with Prominent Haptic turned on (I did this after a couple of days
    and have left it on since), you won't miss any important notifications, or helpful
    indicators like turn directions when navigating.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter
    size-full wp-image-1151087 img-full\" src=\"https://77minds.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/screen-shot-2015-04-29-at-5-27-34-pm.png\"
    alt=\"Screen Shot 2015-04-29 at 5.27.34 PM\" width=\"1024\" height=\"743\" data-originalSrc=\"https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/screen-shot-2015-04-29-at-5-27-34-pm.png\"
    data-rehosted=\"1\">\r\n\r\nThe best part about taptic may be that it seems almost
    certain to make it out to the rest of Apple's product lineup eventually (it's
    already in the new Force Touch trackpads, after all). Experiencing it on the Apple
    Watch, it's hard not to get excited about a future in which Apple's devices share
    not only industrial design and software language, but also a signature haptic
    response, as well.\r\n<h2>Activity and Workout</h2>\r\nWith the Apple Watch pre-launch
    push, a big part of the story Apple told was around the device's health-related
    features. These are found mostly in the Activity and Workout apps on the Watch,
    where you can track your general physical wellness, and specific activities like
    runs or bicycle rides respectively.\r\n\r\nI'm an avid runner, and have used a
    host of different wearables and activity trackers to try to maintain some kind
    of record of my regular runs (between once a day and once every two days, depending
    on how lazy I get). I am not, however, very committed to continuous heart rate
    training or anything so specialized, just to give you a sense of how I approached
    evaluating the Watch as a fitness device.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full
    wp-image-1151091 img-full\" src=\"https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/apple-watch-activity.jpg\"
    alt=\"apple-watch-activity\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\">\r\n\r\nFor my purposes,
    it's the perfect activity tracker, mostly because it's one I'm already wearing.
    I've never been able to consistently use things like the Fitbit or Jawbone UP
    (it inevitably ends up in a drawer because it's too niche) and dedicated devices
    for more serious athletes like GPS runner's watches likewise end up gathering
    dust.\r\n\r\nApple Watch is an effective fitness tool because it tracks your activity
    whether you tell it to explicitly using the Workout app or not, and therein lies
    its value. Whatever you may think about its scientific accuracy or suitability
    for high-performance training, it's the first activity tracker that stands a good
    chance of remaining in active use for a long period of time, and that's what counts
    for most people, and for me.\r\n<h2>Battery</h2>\r\nThe Apple Watch's battery
    works as advertised, meaning you'll be able to use it for a full day, and you'll
    have to charge it during the evening or at night – every day. It's not a dream
    situation, but it also becomes a habit faster than you might expect.\r\n\r\n<img
    class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1151092\" src=\"https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/apple-watch-battery.jpg\"
    alt=\"apple-watch-battery\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\">\r\n\r\nI was also expecting
    to have to watch my usage closely to make sure I made it through a day, given
    how much I anticipated using it; luckily, the closest I've come to exhausting
    the battery (aside from day one, which involved a lot of filming and setup) was
    when I hit the bed with 3 percent remaining after a long day with not one, but
    two active Workouts. Throughout the rest of my time with Apple Watch, it's hit
    the charger with around 30 percent remaining.\r\n<h1>Bottom Line</h1>\r\nThe Apple
    Watch is a unique device that was, for a host of reasons, harder to review for
    a general audience than just about any of Apple's other products. Part of it is
    the personal nature of a computer you wear nearly all the time. That said, during
    the course of my experience with Apple Watch, it's become apparent that I won't
    go back to life without one.\r\n\r\nFor most people, the Apple Watch Sport is
    probably the best choice right now, given some of the version one hiccups the
    Watch still exhibits, but I think most iPhone users will find it adds significantly
    to the experience of owning an Apple smartphone, and the list of benefits it offers
    is only going to get longer over time.</div>\";s:18:\"galleries_mirrored\";i:1;s:15:\"images_mirrored\";i:16;}"
