    Python</a> (Kickstarter alert!), a lean and fast implementation of the Python
    scripting language that is optimized to run on a microcontroller. It includes
    a complete parser, compiler, virtual machine, runtime system, garbage collector
    and <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">was written from scratch</span>.
    Micro Python currently supports 32-bit ARM processors like the STM32F405 (168MHz
    Cortex-M4, 1MB flash, 192KB ram) shown in the picture above and will be open source
    once the already successful campaign finishes. Running your python program is
    as simple as copying your file to the platform (detected as a mass storage device)
    and rebooting it. The official micro python board includes a micro SD card slot,
    4 LEDs, a switch, a real-time clock, an accelerometer and has plenty of I/O pins
    to interface many peripherals. A nice video can be found on the campaign page
    and an interview with the project creator is embedded after the break.\r\n\r\n<!--more-->\r\n\r\n<span
    style=\"color:#009900;\"><em>[Mathieu]</em></span> Hi Damien, thanks for taking
    the time to answer our questions. After only a few <span style=\"font-size:14px;line-height:1.5;\">days,
    your Kickstarter campaign was already successful. With 17 days to go, we </span><span
    style=\"font-size:14px;line-height:1.5;\">look forward to seeing how many people
    will receive your boards once the campaign </span><span style=\"font-size:14px;line-height:1.5;\">finishes.</span>\r\n\r\n<em><span
    style=\"color:#ee0000;\">[Damien]</span></em> Thanks Mathieu/Hack-a-day for the
    opportunity to talk about Micro Python. I'm really excited about this project
    and it's awesome to see such a positive response in the first few days of the
    campaign. I've tried to combine functionality with minimalism in the Micro Python
    board and I'm really looking forward to sending them out to all my backers.\r\n\r\n<span
    style=\"color:#009900;\"><em>[Mathieu]</em></span> Our feeling at HaD is that
    many people might underestimate the work you put in to rewrite the Python scripting
    language from scratch. How many hours did it take you? Can you describe your process?\r\n\r\n<em><span
    style=\"color:#ee0000;\">[Damien]</span></em> Yes, it took some time, and lots
    of programming tricks, to get Micro Python to fit on a microcontroller. Let me
    say though that it's not 100% Python: it has exactly the same grammar as Python
    3.x, and can emit the same byte code, but the libraries (which make Python what
    it is) are not all there, yet. Using Micro Python definitely feels the same as
    using Python (it has <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop\">REPL</a>
    running on the board), and I'm trying to get as many libraries working as possible.\r\n\r\nI've
    been working on Micro Python for just over six months, in my spare time. Probably
    clocked up over 700 hours by now. It's been a lot of fun, selecting components,
    designing the PCB, soldering parts by hand (mostly with a hot-air gun -- they
    are so awesome!), and writing the Python implementation itself.\r\n\r\nThe Micro
    Python software was initially running just on my PC, and I started from the beginning
    with a simple hand-written lexical analyser. The next part, the parser, was tricky
    to write because I wanted it to be as small as possible (in code) and use as little
    RAM as I could get away with. I ended up encoding the grammar in a static data
    structure (using some C preprocessor magic) and writing a single 320-line non-recursive
    function to interpret this table on the fly and parse the Python source. The output
    of the parser is a parse tree, which is fed into the compiler.\r\n\r\nFor the
    compiler, I wanted to be able to emit native machine code, so that Python would
    run as fast as possible on the micro. I needed to learn how to encode Thumb machine
    instructions for this bit, and then turn the stack-machine style code that comes
    out of the compiler into register-machine style, to take full advantage of the
    RISC CPU. I also implemented a byte code emitter and virtual machine, so that Micro
    Python can easily run on other hardware.\r\n\r\nEventually Micro Python was running
    on my PC, and then I ported it across to the microcontroller. This went surprisingly
    well and I had it running in a couple of days. Initially I did not have a memory
    manager, so it would quickly run out of memory on the micro, but then I implemented
    a simple mark-sweep garbage collector and that works really well.\r\n\r\n<span
    style=\"color:#009900;\"><em>[Mathieu]</em></span> Did you write the complete
    bootloader related code yourself? Did you use any library and if so which ones?\r\n\r\n<em><span
    style=\"color:#ee0000;\">[Damien]</span></em> The bootloader is built in to the
    micro that I use: it's DFU (device firmware upgrade) which means you just hold
    a few pins at certain logic levels and reset the chip, and then you can flash
    it over a USB connection. This also makes it easy for users to upgrade the Micro
    Python image without any special hardware, and means that you can never brick
    the device.\r\n\r\nFor the peripherals on the board (like GPIO pins and SD card
    controller) I used the standard STM libraries, and interfaced them to Micro Python.
    I also used the awesome FatFs library by [ChaN] to provide filesystem functionality.\r\n\r\n<span
    style=\"color:#009900;\"><em>[Mathieu]</em></span> Did you already know everything
    that you needed to do when starting this project? Did you learn many things along
    the way?\r\n\r\n<em><span style=\"color:#ee0000;\">[Damien]</span></em> I can't
    even begin to tell you how much I learned doing this project. I have in the past
    written a few programming languages, including ones that compile to machine code
    (x86), and I've had experience with many different microcontrollers. But putting
    everything together, from the hardware right up to the high-level software, exposes
    you to a whole new set of problems that you've got to learn to solve. For example,
    learning how to write USB device descriptors, learning how to layout a compact
    PCB, and even learning new ways of doing things in C!\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color:#009900;\"><em>[Mathieu]</em></span>
    Could you point our readers to a few good reads on how to create a lexer, parser,
    compiler, garbage collector and virtual machine like you did?\r\n\r\n<em><span
    style=\"color:#ee0000;\">[Damien]</span></em> My knowledge came from so many different
    places: books, university courses, the internet, and just mucking about. I think
    implementing a language is one of the most satisfying programming tasks you could
    ever do, and it doesn't have to be difficult. If you want to read a book, go for
    \"Compilers: Principles, Techniques, and Tools\" by [Aho], [Lam] and [Sethi],
    also known as the \"Dragon Book\". If you just want to start hacking, set yourself
    the task of implementing a \"stack machine\", as that will give you the basic
    understanding of most of the pieces.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color:#009900;\"><em>[Mathieu]</em></span>
    A few people on IRC told us that you were accustomed to lengthy projects, could
    you tell us a bit more about other things you've done?\r\n\r\n<em><span style=\"color:#ee0000;\">[Damien]</span></em>
    My day job is as a theoretical physicist, and in this field you have projects like
    the LHC (Large Hadron Collider) that take more than 30 years. Of course, my personal
    physics projects don't last this long, but it can still take years to go from
    the initial idea to finally writing up the research paper. My longest hardware
    project was undoubtedly building my CNC machine (which features at the end of
    the Kickstarter video). For this I designed my own stepper motor control boards,
    wrote firmware for an Atmel micro to do the high-level control (not G-code, but
    similar), designed and built the actual machine (that took over a year...) and
    wrote all the PC-side software. I even wrote a 3D modelling program to design
    the machine. Probably overkill.\r\n\r\nI also spent the last year and a half building,
    with a friend, the website <a href=\"http://paperscape.org/\">paperscape.org</a>,
    which maps the scientific landscape of research papers. The longest part of this
    project was implementing (in Python) a LaTeX/TeX parser which could automatically
    extract bibliographic information to work out how papers are connected.\r\n\r\nI
    think Micro Python has been the most fun and most challenging project that I have
    worked on so far. And there's still heaps more to do. One thing I like about this
    project is the feedback I'm getting from people, and all their suggestion on how
    to improve Micro Python. I look forward to building up a community around this
    and having Micro Python running on all kinds of hardware, and doing all kinds
    of amazing things.</div>\";s:15:\"images_mirrored\";i:1;}"
