I  was taking a [Python Datascience course](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:UCSanDiegoX+DSE200x+2T2017/course/)
on Edx, when in one of the video tutorials I  saw this:

I  was stunned. Why? Because you see a car in there? It was created by me. You can
find it in Openclipart here [https://openclipart.org/detail/173850/race-car](https://openclipart.org/detail/173850/race-car)

It was very pleasing to see my work been used in one of the course I am taking.
This is how freedom progresses, you do a work and give it away for free, then
some one uses it as a building block in his or her work and uses it for something
and give it off for free.

The course I am taking comes in two version, one is free and another costs $350.
Unfortunately my image is available in paid version too and not even a dollar
will be given me out of the $350 charged.

Well thats how the world works.
