<p>Today saw in papers that China has started Asian, and rightly India became an member too. This bank is crucial for the world Economy, this will weaken the dollar and will promote exports from USA thus increasing the jobs there. Its time for the world to become multi-polar,  unfortunately the Russians are too weak, USA has set up traps all around them, the latest being Ukraine and Russia is struggling. I hope India remembers all the help that USSR and Russia did during its mighty years and we must help the Russians as much as possible.</p>
<p>Trade between Russia and China, and China and India must grow. We simply can't keep relying on the west for everything. We must realize just like India, USA is not a free country, its controlled by a thousand Tycoons upon which its economy depends on, but people in both these nations don't really know about it and think they enjoy flawless democracy. In China people simply know that they are controlled by business and government mingled together and they must be aware that they are slaves. Thats the major difference between the democratic and socialist world.</p>
<p>USA is trying to lay traps around China, Hong Kong and demand for democracy is one. USA has failed to export peace and democracy to Vietnam, Afganistan, Iraq. It has ridiculed Iran and Hamas though they do have democracy. In short if some one is not willing to do business with USA, they are evil and undemocratic.</p>
<p>China and USA have a common history. USA until recently thrived on  black slaves, China thrives on by making its own people slaves. USA occupied territories from many Indian tribes from its east coast in Atlantic to the Pacific in west. China conducted atrocities against Tibet, religious believers, mainly Muslims in its western provinces and occupied their territories. USA went against India, made friendship with Pakistan and is now repenting for it, China has made friendship with Pakistan and will repent when its Muslims indulge in terrorism soon.</p>
<p>One thing however China leads over USA. That is much of the USA's intellect seems to be from migrant workers, for example thousands of people that travel there to make out a living, but on the other hand China seems to able to grow its own intellectuals and is able to provide a platform for them thrive in its own nations. That's some thing India has failed to do, where even tiny nation like Japan and South Korea has succeeded well. China seem to have an ability to have a disciplined population that can grow intellect of its own than depend on migrants, thats an advantage and that should envy USA the most.</p>
<p>Any way congratulation China to have become the Worlds largest economy.</p>
