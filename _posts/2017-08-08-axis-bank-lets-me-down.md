Have been in times where you have to transfer money or make a payment at a crucial 
time? A situation like that happened to me yesterday and I had to use Axis bank
payment method. I entered the amount that has to be paid and I waited for OTP (
one time password). I waited and waited it never arrived. I hit the "RESEND OTP" button
and it was still the same. I waited. Then I hit the "On Call OTP" button and
still nothing happened even though I was promised to receive a call within a
minute.

Then after 20 - 30 minutes or so I got the OTP (definetly an expired on by now).
Thinking that their systems have became normal I tried paying once again and it 
was the same. No new OTP came and I never got a call that would spell out an OTP
for me.

I went for lunch, nearly 90 minutes later I got series of calls from Axis bank,
a robot called me and chatted out OTP to me. Grrr, I was in hotel, and even if I
had stayed on web page and continued, my session would have expired.
 
 Axis bank is third largest Bank in India and its technology is so weak. I am an
 engineer and as web engineer we deal with problem like these. What should happen
 if your server is over loaded? What should happen if there is an earthquake where
 your servers are located? Believe me, without leaving the comfort of your couch
 you can Google for answers and implement it. No kidding. Its difficult to think
 such a large institution would have neglected to think in that way.
 
 At the least they could have sent or shown me a message saying that their system
 queue is overloaded and its not advisable to do a transaction online. This problem
 I think still persists at this moment, I made a payment via check finally. I wonder
 why these banks boast of digital banking. 
 
 I hope bitcoin catches up in India.
