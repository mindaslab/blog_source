I use Firefox, i don't really know why I like it, possibly because its one of those
top browsers which claim to support user freedom, but in raality its not. Chrome
browser is far worst, it turns on your microphone while you browse, possibly listens to it
transmitting what you say to google.

There was however one problem with firefox that nagged me. Firefox was really slow
compared with Chrome. Now firefox has improve, its lightning fast, consumes far less
memory compared to other top  browsers, but it still sucks.

Stability of Firefox is in question here. Though its fast it crashes often. I see
the screen below all the time

I have heard how miserable it is for people to work in firefox. Rather than adopting
a culture of freedom and openness, they have become more corporate like. This seems
to have adversely affected team morale and subsequently the quality of the browser.

Hope they change and become an open cultural group again.
