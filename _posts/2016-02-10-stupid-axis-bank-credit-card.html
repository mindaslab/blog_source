<p>Got a fucking call from Axis Bank Credit Card department. They said a credit card has been approved for me. I said I don't need a credit card, but they said its approved. Its like this,Â  I walk down a street, a waiter from the hotel runs to me and says "sir your food is ready", I say "I am not hungry" for which the waiter replies "no sir we know you have money in your pocket and we want to empty it".</p>
<p>Sweet talk, girls voice, and blah blah have trapped many in this credit cards and have made them poppers. So to counter it, I said I am a real estate agent. Well, I really am. I offered him a deal, just like he told many advantages of credit card, I told many advantages of having a home. Then I cut him a deal, if he can buy home from me (that too 20% below market rate) , I will get a credit card from him. That annoying fucker declined.</p>
<p>If I want food I can walk into a hotel and get it. Wonder when banks will really start serving people than making people borrowers and thus controlling their life's.</p>
