Today @ office, a lady from below came to give some money to me, it was some adjustments for our office complex maintenance.  I opened the wooden door and through the grill gate stretched my hand to receive it. To my surprise she told me to open the grill gate, I wondered why when a bank note would just slip through the grills? Any way she looked far older than me and I did not want to  disappoint her, so I opened the grill and showed my hand. To my surprise, she asked me step out of the office door. I was utterly confused, but coming out of Hindu family I understood this was just another blind faith. When I stepped out she handed me the cash.

In office there was a guy who is a regular Hindu, he told that there is rule in Hinduism which prevents such money transfer. Damn humans!!! What that lady is going to do next? Perform [Sati](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sati_(practice)) when her husband dies? Why? Why? WHY people are so stupid?

Its not just Hindus. Its all religions i feel are crack. Pork tastes so good and Muslims won't eat it. Beef is plentiful and Hindus won't eat it. I also came across a group called Jehovah Witness which says Christians are crack, but they believe none is dead. In short a group that consists of crack people says Christian religion is crack. Wonder how they figured it out?

Is it not high time for Human race to throw blind faith out and embrace science?
