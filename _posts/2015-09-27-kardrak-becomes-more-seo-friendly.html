<p>Well, in this week of code iteration, we have made sure Kardrak has become more SEO friendly. We have found some startling stuff about search engines and their algorithms.</p>
<p>In my blog seized by Tamilnadu police (yup India is not a true democracy) https://karthikeyanblogs.wordpress.com/2013/01/20/be-honest-than-seo/ , I had argued that one must be honest than making his page SEO, but here I am concentrating on SEO, why? The reason is simple, thats my blog, and I don't like SEO, Kardrak is an enterprise which I am building for wellness of humanity and especially people who like them and their businesses known to the world, hence it has got SEO features. I wish search engines will pick it up soon and better rank us.</p>
<p>So lets see what the future holds... :D</p>
