The government is afraid of people getting knowledge. Well thats what the signal
Indian government is sending out. Recently it had blocked [Archive org](https://archive.org/),
why? Well none knows why really why? But in India somehow government seems to get away violating
the constitution now and then.

Its strange that a country that calls itself a democracy is unwilling to let
its people experience the world via the internet 100%. India claims that its citizens
have the right to information and free speech, and right to have rights granted
by our constitution but its really good at hiding things.

Take for instance the article 49-O which we know now as NOTA or No To Anybody. This
means in each election apart from the list of candidates provided, the voters
should have a NOTA option. That is they should be able to tell that they like
to vote for none. For more than 60 years our politicians have stealthily kept
this right given to us by our constitution away from us. Why?

Why a ruler who really wants to respect constitution of India do such a thing?
The reason? Politicians if they can fool people at every opportunity thats
available to them, they will fool us for their gain. It doesn't matter we are
ruled by Congress, BJP or some coalition.

The Panama papers have named lot of people who were indulged in looting their
nation and stashing money into Panama. Because of its leak the Pakistani
Priminister Nawaz Sharif had to step down, but why it hasn't affected India?
Whole India gossips that a mere actress like Aishwariya Rai had evaded taxes and
stashed wealth in Panama, have you ever wondered why and how she is free? Infact
she is not even a drop in the vast ocean of India's wealth thats looted and
stashed in other countries. Why are we more weaker in implementing justice than
Pakistan who we regard as barbaric tribesmen invading our land?

Internet helps people to distribute things like Panama papers, Wikileaks documents
and others in much easier fashion. These things can be easily hosted on [Archive org](https://archive.org/)
or [Pirate bay](https://thepiratebay.org/) and so on for all Indians to see, and
it terrifies the Indian government, the oligarchy and the rich to know that people
have the way to know and find out about their corruption.

In fact time and again Torrent sites gets banned in India all of a sudden and we
don't know why. When an Islamic terrorist puts up a site say about how he plans
to destroy India, it will be banned here. We as citizens are not allowed to know
who threatens us, and most important we should never know why he is doing it.

India is actively discouraging bitcoin too as it fears that people will find true
financial freedom and possibly big money banks won't be able to fund political
parties. Having a good relationship between banks and politicians is important.
For example there is a guy called Vijay Mallaya who looted India of 9000 crores
and is happy in London. India is simply doing nothing because he might have nexus
with Subramaniya Swamy of the Ruling BJP. So since this guy has looted the bank
which is called SBI, to offset its loss it (SBI) starts to loot people. SBI says SMS
bank statement is charged, there is charge if you maintain a balance thats low, there is a charge
if you move money in and out of your account, there is charge if you breathe.
So it lost 9000 crores to a man connected with politicians and is now aiming to
loot Rs 900 from each of its 10 crore customers. With bitcoin that won't be the case.

If you are an Indian, there is just one thing you must know. Your government says
you are a free citizen, and its say it is good . Then why the hell its blocking
us to use the internet in free way? Doesn't things smell fishy here?
