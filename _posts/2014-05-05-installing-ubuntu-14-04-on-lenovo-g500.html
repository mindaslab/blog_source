<p>Got a Lenovo G500 laptop with AMD Radeon graphic chipset in it. The installation went well, but then after restart this screen appeared and I did not know what to do. So I went from blog to blog and found a thing out, which I will be presenting it here.</p>
<p>So I found my answer in this link http://askubuntu.com/questions/141606/how-to-fix-the-system-is-running-in-low-graphics-mode-error . Not all works, what worked for me will be presented here. When you restart your Ubuntu machine, you will get a screen as shown</p>
<p>[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="664"]<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/AiwJH.png" alt="" width="664" height="482" /> Ubuntu Low Graphics Mode[/caption]</p>
<p>Press enter, you will get some other screen, now press Ctrl+Alt+F1 and you will goto command line, Ubuntu will ask for your username and password, please provide the credentials which you provided during installation.</p>
<p>Next in command line just give the following</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo apt-get install xserver-xorg-video-ati xserver-xorg-video-radeon</code></pre>
<p>Once done give this command to reboot</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo reboot</code></pre>
<p>If it works, worship me like God and send me 10 million British pounds.</p>
